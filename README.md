# FPGA-Based Pong Game
This project is a 2-player Pong game implemented entirely on an FPGA using Verilog HDL. The game is displayed in real time using VGA output, with hardware-level control of graphics, text rendering, and game logic. It features a clean FSM architecture, interactive paddle control, ball physics, collision detection, scoring system, and game-over handling.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
Two-player Pong gameplay (one paddle on each side)

VGA display at 640x480 resolution (25â€¯MHz pixel clock)

Paddles controlled via physical buttons

Ball movement with collision detection (walls and paddles)

Game state FSM (NEW GAME â†’ PLAY â†’ NEW BALL â†’ GAME OVER)

Game-over screen when a player loses all lives

On-screen text rendering for:

"PLAYER1: X" and "PLAYER2: Y"
